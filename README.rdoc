= PrecompiledHaml

The idea of that gem was next: Haml compiles views into ruby code each request,
and we can speed up this process if we'll do some precopilation on deployment
(like asset pipeline, but for views).

After raw impementation, I make a/b tests for rendering some haml views - and
there was no difference (in fact precopiled views was slightly slower).

So I'm satisfied by speed of haml and stop next development of this gem :)

This project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.
